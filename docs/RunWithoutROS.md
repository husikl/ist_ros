# Video Annotations and Data Collection with IST-ROS
This document provides a guide on using IST_ROS for video annotations and data collection, using a video file in mp4 format as input. The provided script allows users to select target objects in the input video and outputs an annotated video with the selected objects segmented in each frame.

## Basic example
To perform video annotation, run the following command:
```
python segment_and_track.py --input_path ./inputs/input_video.mp4 --output_path ./outputs/videos/output_video.mp4
```
## Arguments
* `--input_path`: Path to the input video.
* `--output_path`: Path to the output video.
* `--point_mode`: Track the targets using points.
* `--disable_mask_mode`: Disable the mask mode for visualization.
* `--save_all_mode`: Save all visualized frames and/or point positions. The saved data depends on the selected visualizing mode.
* `--save_all_path`: Path to save data when `--save_all_mode` is enabled.

## Workflow
1. Run the script with the appropriate arguments.
1. A tkinter GUI window will appear.
1. Select one target at a time using the following operations:
    * Draw a bounding box around the object by clicking and dragging the mouse.
    * Right-click on the object to specify it as foreground or background. You can change the mode using bottun.
1. Click the "Generate Masks" button to display and register the masked image. 
    * If you are not satisfied with the results, use the "Reselect" or "Clear All" button to remove them.
1. Repeat steps 3-4 for each object you want to track.
1. After selecting all targets, click the "Start Tracking" button to initiate the video annotation.

For detailed instructions on using the GUI, please refer to `GUI.md`.
## Outputs
The script will process the input video and save the output video with the tracked objects at the specified output path (`--output_path`).
If `--save_all_mode` is enabled, the script will also save all visualized frames and/or mask positions at the specified path (`--save_all_path`).
